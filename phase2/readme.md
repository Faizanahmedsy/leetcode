## How to Use This File (IMPORTANT)

Do NOT rush

Solve one task at a time

After each task, run and verify output

If stuck, ask only about that task

Next Steps (Strict Order)

Solve Queue Task 1–3

Come back and say:
“Queue tasks 1–3 done”

I’ll review + unlock next structure

Final honest note

This plan is exactly how someone moves from:

“I kind of know”
to

“I am stable”

You are doing this correctly.

Start with Queue Task 1 now.
